# Corso-Sistemi_Embedded
Repository Embedded System Course


## Student learning outcomes
The course provides the methodological and technological knowledge for the analysis and synthesis of modern "embedded systems" (ie those special and general computer systems designed to be embedded in industrial products (transport, energy, mechanical systems, etc.) or (Telephony, entertainment, multimedia processing, etc.) that are bound to meet certain real-time and performance requirements, as well as requirements on consumption, bulk, reliability and security.

The student is embarked on the design of embedded systems based on SoC (System on Chip), MPSoC (Multiplex Processor on Single Chip) and special (DSP, dedicated hardware) architectures built with FPGA technologies. Design will use development methods and IDE environments widely used in industry.

A large part of the Lab uses industrial IDE environments (consisting of HDL-VHDL, VERILOG and System-C compilers, debuggers, simulators, and technology mapping tools) and is designed to provide the necessary knowledge for synthesizing Circuits on FPGA devices, and for designing SoC systems with ARM processor on board STM32F4 from S & T Microelectronics, with Sparc synthesized on FPGA Spartan 3 on board Digilent NEXYS 2 and Intel on board Galileo processors.

In this context, a complete classroom project will be developed for the creation of a complete embedded system, organized into subsystems assigned to the various working groups.

## Program of the course

The course is organized in three main parts: a theoretical, a technological and an applicative.

## Theoretical part

• Special and general purpose architecture of Embedded Systems and their structuring at levels.

• hardware architectures based on the integration of off the shelf  hardware (processors, peripherals, mutiprocessors, microcomputer, DSP, system on chip, etc.), specific hardware (designed by VHDL and automatic synthesis technologies) and devices for connection with actuators and sensors Field;

• Architectural features of processors and systems for system applications such as System on Chip (SoC) and Multiprocessor System on Chip (MPSoc).

• Basic software, operating systems and application software for dedicated systems with or without real-time constraints;

• characterization of the development cycle of processing systems for critical industrial applications for cost, reliability, time, safety, consumption and bulk density;

• Design cycle: modeling techniques (formal and simulation models); Techniques and tools for synthesis; Analysis and evaluation of performance and reliability.

• partition logic of a dedicated system between functional units built into hardware and / or software for embedded systems SoC and MPSoC;

## Technological part

• Basic programmable devices: PROM, E ^ {2} PROM, PLA, PAL, etc.

• ASIC and FPGA devices.

• System on Chip (SoC) and Multiprocessor System on Chip (MPSoc).

• Architectures of the most popular embedded processor systems: the ARM family; The SPARC architecture and its open source implementation (Gaisler's Leon3); Native processors of FPGA families (Xilinx MicroBlaze); Other synthesizable processors such as IpCore on FPGAs (8, 16, 32-bit CISC and RISC, Java machine processors).

• Syncable I/O devices such as IPCore (UART/USART, PIO, I2C, SPI, USB, etc.).

• Synthesis and use of ROM/RAM and Flash memories.

• Bus and High Performance Interconnection Systems.

• Sensors and actuators: operating principles, typology, interfaces and usage examples.

• Sensor networks: functional, architectural and application aspects.

## Applicative part & Laboratory

The course is designed to design modern embedded systems based on SoC (System on Chip), MPSoC (Multiple Processor on Single Chip) and special (DSP, dedicated hardware) architectures embedded in VLSI commercial chips or on programmable devices such as ASICs or The FPGAs.

Design will use development methods and IDE environments that are widely used in industry. In particular, all Hw/Sw levels of an embedded system will be analyzed, detailing:

• Basic components for their implementation such as memory subsystems, hierarchical bus systems or less, interconnection networks and NOCs (network on chips);

• special components based on ASIP and DSP

• Programmable FPGAs that contain both special machines (dedicated hardware of a combination type, synchronous / asynchronous, dedicated hardware systems built from IP-Core components, "Intellectual Property Core", specially developed or present in libraries Commercial) and proprietary or open IP-Core, of general purpose and / or special RISC / CISC processors;

• the I/O subsystem characterized by the most common I/O devices, sensors and actuators, and their networks;

• Hybrid systems that on a single interconnection platform integrate different types of IP core, thus creating multiprocessor architectures.

• middleware and S.O. Even with real-time requirements
